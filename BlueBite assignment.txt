Automation :
Ceated a script file by using Cypress and attached the file to email for output reference 

Provide instructions on how to run automated tests

Step 1: Set Up Your Project : Initialize Your Project:

If you don't already have a Node.js project, create one by running the following commands in your terminal:

mkdir my-cypress-project
cd BlueBite
npm init -y
Install Cypress:

Install Cypress as a dev dependency:

npm install cypress --save-dev
Open Cypress:

Open Cypress for the first time to generate the necessary files and folders:

npx cypress open

This will create a cypress folder and a cypress.json configuration file in your project directory.
Step 2: Write Your Tests and create Test Files

Cypress organizes tests into e2e folder. Create a new test file in cypress/e2e, for example, Enter chance to win.cy:

"describe" :  is used to group related tests.
"it" : represents an individual test case.

Step 3: Run Your Tests
Run Tests in the Cypress Test Runner: Open Cypress to use its interactive test runner:

npx cypress open

Select the test file you created to run it in the interactive mode. 
This mode is useful for debugging and seeing how tests interact with your application in real-time.
Run Tests in Headless Mode:

To run tests in a headless mode (useful for CI/CD pipelines), use:

npx cypress run

This command will execute all test files in the cypress/e2e folder.
Step 4: Continuous Integration : Set Up a CI Configuration
